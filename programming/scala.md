# Function
* Scala Lambdas
>A lambda or, more specifically a lambda expression is a term used to refer to an expression that does not reference a value or variable, but instead references an anonymous function.
>Scala supports the idea of lambda expressions quite nicely, and in several different forms, but itâ€™s easy to confuse them with other similar constructs, like closures.
