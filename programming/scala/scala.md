# Function
* Scala Lambdas
>A lambda or, more specifically a lambda expression is a term used to refer to an expression that does not reference a value or variable, but instead references an anonymous function.
>Scala supports the idea of lambda expressions quite nicely, and in several different forms, but itâ€™s easy to confuse them with other similar constructs, like closures.

# Notes
Q1. Difference between a Seq and a List in Scala
* In Java terms, Scala's `Seq` would be Java's `List`, and Scala's `List` would be Java's `LinkedList`.
* Note that `Seq` is a `trait`, which is equivalent to Java's interface, but with the equivalent of up-and-coming defender methods. Scala's `List` is an `abstract class` that is extended by Nil and ::, which are the concrete implementations of List.
