# Key Concepts
## cryptography
* **Symmetric-key cryptography**, where a single key is used for encryption and decryption. Symmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key (or, less commonly, in which their keys are different but related in an easily computable way).
* **Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography** , is any cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. This accomplishes two functions: `authentication`, where the public key verifies that a holder of the paired private key sent the message, and `encryption`, where only the paired private key holder can decrypt the message encrypted with the public key.

# SSH
## Concepts
* **Secure Shell (SSH)** is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network
