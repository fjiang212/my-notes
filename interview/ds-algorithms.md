## Data Structure
* [FIxed Size Array](http://www.programmeronrails.com/2015/11/13/fixed-size-array/)
    * Initialization
    ```
    int[] arr = new int[3];
    int arr[] = new int[3]; // or (less preferred)
    int[] arr = {v0, v1, v2};
    int arr[] = {v0, v1, v2}; // or (less preferred)
    ```
    * Performance
        * Fixed size array probably is the fastest data structure in most languages. For operations such as getting/setting values on an array by index, they could be completed in `O(1)` time.
        * The major downside of arrays is that the size of an array needs to be pre-defined. So if the size of the data can be changed, often we may need to define an array of of larger space than needed.
