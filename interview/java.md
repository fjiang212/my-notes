# Basic Java
1. **Why java is not 100% Object-oriented?**

Java is not 100% Object-oriented because it makes use of eight `primitive datatypes` such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short which are not objects. Wrapper classes converts the java primitives into the reference types (objects). Every primitive data type has a class dedicated to it.
