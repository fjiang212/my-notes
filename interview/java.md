# Basic Java
**Q1. Why java is not 100% Object-oriented?**

Java is not 100% Object-oriented because it makes use of eight `primitive datatypes` such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short which are not objects. Wrapper classes converts the java primitives into the reference types (objects). Every primitive data type has a class dedicated to it.

**Q1. What is the difference between equals() and == ?**

Equals() method is defined in Object class in Java and used for checking equality of two objects defined by business logic.
“==” or equality operator in Java is a binary operator provided by Java programming language and used to compare primitives and objects. public boolean equals(Object o) is the method provided by the Object class. The default implementation uses == operator to compare two objects.

**Q1. What is Polymorphism?**

Polymorphism is briefly described as “one interface, many implementations”. Polymorphism is a characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts – specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one form. There are two types of polymorphism:
* Compile time polymorphism
* Run time polymorphism

Compile time polymorphism is method overloading whereas Runtime time polymorphism is done using inheritance and interface.
