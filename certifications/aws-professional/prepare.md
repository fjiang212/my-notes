# Study Best Practices
* Do not register for the exam until you have completed the course and met the study best practices. Scheduling the exam and then beginning to study is a sure way to rush the learning process.
* Download the slides to study from, and to help memorize any needed information.
* Use the practice exam system to help get a feel for how much time to spend on each question.
* Do not blindly study the answers on the practice exam results page. First, see what questions you got wrong and research why. This helps with understanding AWS concepts and becoming a qualified CSA professional.
* Watching the videos and taking the labs should only be 40% of your study. You must continue to review the slides and take the self-paced labs to ensure you have a deeper understanding of the content.
* Read the required white pages linked in this study guide. It is suggested that you also read the suggested white papers.
* You should spend at least two weeks studying, going back and reviewing videos, asking questions,and reading the slides.
* It never hurts to take an AWS practice exam by AWS or to read AWS services FAQ.
* If you spend time studying and reviewing the course for 1 to 2 weeks after completing the course on LinuxAcademy.com, your odds of success go up to at least 90%.
* Rushing to pass is the best way to fail the exam.
* Before you take the exam, take three days off of studying then go back and try the practice exam for your third and last time. If you pass, then schedule the exam.
